# Expense-tracker
We are creating an Expense Tracker application in Java. It involves designing a system that allows users to add expenses, categorise them, view a summary and possibly save the data from a file.

We would be applying OOP concepts, data structure concepts, Java basics and javafx. 

Features - 
- Add an expense
- Categorise them
- View a list of expenses
- View total expenses or filter by category
- Save or load data
